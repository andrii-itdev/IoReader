# Io Reader

IoReader (Io - one of the largest moons of the planet Jupiter) is an open-source reader application crafted to make your reading experience more delightful.

It is designed to support multiple formats (epub, fb2, txt, djvu, pdf), to be flexible in its configuration and have an adjustable outlook. The reader supports bookmarks and automatically saves the last open location in the book after the application is closed. It has a library and bookshelves so that it is easier to view, navigate, and search your books. Also, a nice feature of the reader is the personal dictionary, which would be extremely useful for people that enjoy reading books in foreign languages.
